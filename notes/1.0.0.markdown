### Api changes

    - Added `submitAndWait` which will submit the command and wait for its final response
    - Rename `submitAll` to `submitAllAndWait` in Command service as it waits for final response of all commands
- `Prefix` creation will throw `NoSuchElementException` if invalid subsystem is provided
