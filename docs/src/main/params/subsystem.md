# Subsystem

TMT Observatory system is composed of many subsystems. The subsystems that are known participants in the TMT Software
System are predefined and the list is covered under the `Subsystem` enumeration. They are identified using an
abbreviation typically of 3 or 4 letters.

**Susbsystem** values are used to construct **[Source](commands.html#Source)** and are used in communication vehicles
such as Commands, Events and States.

@@@ note

Subsystems are made available via separate files, for consumption in Scala and Java code.

* Import `csw.prefix.models.Subsystem` for **Scala**
* Import `csw.prefix.javadsl.JSubsystem` for **Java**.
