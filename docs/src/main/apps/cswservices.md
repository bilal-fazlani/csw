## Supported Commands

@@@ warning  { title='Caution' }

`csw-services` only requires the following things to be set before starting the Database Service:

- The `PGDATA` environment variable set to the Postgres data directory where Postgres is installed e.g. for mac: "/usr/local/var/postgres".
- Password set for the valid Postgres user. If not, go to the Postgres shell via `psql` and run `ALTER USER <username> WITH PASSWORD '<mypassword>';`.

Also it is not required to set `INTERFACE_NAME` environment variable explicitly but if in any case it is not assigned correctly, For Example,
if multiple interfaces are present on the machine, then one needs to set it explicitly.
